# Autoencoder_cFOS
Autoencoder Convolutional_Neural_Network for reducing Noise_to_signal ratio in Confocal cFOS Images

## Introduction

For a comprehensive scientific description of the project, please refer to the detailed documentation provided in the PDF file titled "Autoencoder_cFOS." 

## Installation
To run this code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

    numpy
    torch
    torchsummary
    PIL
    os
    transforms from torchvision
    matplotlib
    IPython
    google.colab

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```python
bash

pip install numpy torch torchsummary Pillow matplotlib

```

## Getting Started

You have to first Mount your Google drive to import images. Use the following code to mount your Google Drive and access your files:
```python
# Mount Google Drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

```
In this step, you need to specify the path of your parent folder where your data is stored. The parent folder should include subfolders corresponding to the groups in your experiment.
```python
# Specify the path of your parent folder
parent_folder_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/YourParentFolder'
Replace 'YourParentFolder' with the actual name of your parent folder.
```
Ensure that your folder structure resembles the following:
```python
YourParentFolder/
├── Group1/
├── Group2/
├── Group3/
# ... (additional groups)
```
Adjust the folder names according to the groups in your experiment.

## Project Structure

Explain the organization of the project files and directories:

    README.md: Project documentation.
    your_script.py: Main Python script containing the code.
    notebooks/: Directory containing Jupyter Notebooks.


## Usage

Describe how to use the code:

    Ensure the required libraries are installed.
    Open and run the provided script or notebook.
    Check the results or outputs in the designated directory.

## Data Preparation

Explain how to prepare the data for training or testing, if applicable.
Results

If the code produces visual results, provide samples or links to the output images.
## Acknowledgments
